      "details": "A portrait can also refer to the orientation of a photograph and is the opposite of a landscape photograph. While most portraits of people are done in portrait orientation it is not unheard of to see portraits created in the landscape.Although the definition of portrait photography sounds simple enough, this form of photography can be complicated to master. Portrait photography can be commercial or fine art which has very different goals. When it comes to fine art photography, the primary goal of portrait photography is to capture beautiful images that appear natural and allow a subject’s personality to shine through.Portrait photographs are also required for countless commercial purposes, such as passports, professional biographies, security passes, and other documentation."
