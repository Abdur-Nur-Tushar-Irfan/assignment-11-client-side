### Project scope

This Projects is mainly use for different services of photography..Firstly I use  6 services in the database, but here, will limit the number to only 3 in home page.I also use a meaningful footer.There will be a " Show all Our Services" button under the 3 services. When clicking the button/icon, take the user to the /services route and show all the services on that page.I also add two extra sections on the home page.The services of the home page and the services of the services page will have the name of the service, image, rating price, a short description and a view details button with each service card.When clicking on the image of the service, the picture will be viewed on full screen.There will be a review section where a user can see others' reviews of that service.I also Implement email/password-based authentication and one social login.The "My reviews" page will be a private route and show only the reviews that the current user added either in a table or in cards with relevant information like - service name, review.you can add a service and that service will be shown on the home page

### Future Plan

For this assignment issue I cant design more effective to my project..inshaAllah in future i will updated my projects.
### Conclusion

In conclusion, this was a successful project because not only did I learn about photography and how it relates to chemistry, but all of our pictures were developed perfectly. This is because we properly agitated the film and had perfect timing. By doing this project, I was able to learn about the history of photography, the parts of the camera, the science behind, and how to develop negative images. Although a camera seems complicated, there are three main parts which are the camera, the lens, and the film. The shutter on the camera allows light to hit the film and active the AgBr (silver bromide) in order to produce an image. In order to develop this image there are several steps which need to take place. Those steps are development, stop bath, fixer (and washes), perma wash, and photo flo. The science behind photography was also very important to this experiment. In this section, I explained how chemistry relates to photography, which was the goal for this project. Not only does this project relate to photography, but it also relates to what we have been learning throughout the year in the textbook. The textbook was able to give us a basic knowledge of what chemistry is and it also told us about mixtures, elements and compounds, and chemical reactions which were all needed to complete this project. Ms. Smith also taught us how to balance equations, basic lab procedures, and safety which were important in order to complete this project and the lab. 

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
